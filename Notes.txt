$$$1. spread operator syntax example: <Todo key={todo.id} {...todo}/> (in the TodoList.js file)

$$$2. Why use Array.map() rather than Array.forEach()?
Array.forEach doesn't do anything with the returned value inside the callback.
forEach itself always returns undefined, not an array.
On the other hand, Array.map() turns all the returned values into a new array which is exactly what we want!
Maps return value is the array of new values.

From the docs for forEach:
"forEach() executes the callback function once for each array element;
unlike map() or reduce() it always returns the value undefined and is not chainable.
The typical use case is to execute side effects at the end of a chain."

$$$3. Arrow functions only implicitly return when using the expression syntax with no curly braces.
The statements syntax with curly braces does require an explicit return statements.
